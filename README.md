### Hi I'm Jan,

I worked several years as a conservation ecology researcher at Phillips-University Marburg, where I fell in love with analyzing data in R and extracting meaningful insights. This love for data (and the dislike for writing publications) made me realize that I would rather be a Data Scientist. To kickstart my career transition I joined a Data Practitioner bootcamp at neuefische, where I learned to use pandas and numpy in python, gather data with SQL and FastAPI, train and track machine learning models in scikit-learn and MLFlow, deploy them as apps with streamlit and showcase analytical findings in Tableau. Ultimately, I and three other trainees used our new skills in a capstone project where we became the Paw Predictors and we build a ML model to predict the adoption speed of shelter animals. More infos can be found in the linked repo below.
